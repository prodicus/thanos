Okay, But what does it do?
--------------------------

-  Whether the password you entered is shitty or not? (for starters)
-  Suggest a new password if you entered a weak password
-  *more to come*

Will I be able to run it on my PC?
----------------------------------

We are planning to release a cross platform version of this tool very
soon, so stay tuned!

What's with the name?
---------------------

Nothing! It's just that I read a lot of Marvel comics.

The code looks messy!
---------------------

As I said, work in progress.

Psst. So does your mom!
